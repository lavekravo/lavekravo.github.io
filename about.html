						Lavekravo is an artist, a scientist, and an educator who enjoys traditional as well as modern art styles. With an artistic mind and a scientific background, they are fascinated by controlled chaotic patterns. Their recent endeavours in the space of generative art explore the influence of carefully injected chaos in rule-based geometric structures. Lavekravo's generative art works are at the confluence of minimalistic design aesthetics and swarming design patterns. 

						<br><br>
						Lavekravo always had an artistic inclination since their childhood. Growing up in a humble culture and being constantly surrounded by native and traditional art, Lavekravo enjoyed learning art and design throughout their grade school. Due to practical circumstances, they decided to pursue their formal education in science which led to them becoming a well-known scientist and academic. Nevertheless, Lavekravo always had the desire to restart their artistic journey, and create art in various forms. With generative art, Lavekravo hopes to push the boundaries of modern art and promote a practical and sustainable art-fostered living.
